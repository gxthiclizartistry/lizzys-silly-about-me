        <h2>About Me ˚ʚ♡ɞ˚ </h2>
    <p>HAI! I'm Liz/Lizzy! I'm an artist and writer that takes extreme passion in my work! I may not be the best, but I'm always working to improve! I've been happily taken by my beloved boyfriend, Storm, for 3 years now! I hope we can grow to become friends and maybe art collab sometime! ˗ˏˋ ♡ ˎˊ˗ </p>
